  """Run inference with a model.

   There are two types of inference you can perform using this PTransform:
   1. In-process inference from a SavedModel instance. Used when
     `saved_model_spec` field is set in `inference_spec_type`.
   2. Remote inference by using a service endpoint. Used when
     `ai_platform_prediction_model_spec` field is set in
     `inference_spec_type`.

  The inference model can be specified in three ways:
  1. For a fixed inference model, provide an InferenceSpecType object as a
     fixed parameter. This inference model will be used for all examples.
     This form of the API has some performance benefits when running inference
     locally as it is easier to cache the inference model.
  2. In a pipeline where the inference model may be updated at runtime, you can
     specify a PCollection of InferenceSpecType objects as a side-input. Each
     example will be joined with the most recent inference spec from this
     PCollection (based on processing time). Any examples that arrive before
     the first model will be buffered until a model is available.
  3. For finer control, you can run inference on a stream of query tuples:
     (InferenceSpecType, Example) where each tuple specifies an example and a
     model to use for inference. Internally, queries with the same inference
     spec will be grouped together and inference will operate on batches of
     examples. To use this api, don't provide an inference_spec_type parameter.

  Note: Options 2 and 3 above both require a Beam runner with stateful DoFn
    support. You can reference the compatability matrix to determine a suitable
    runner: (https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix).

  TODO(b/131873699): Add support for the following features:
  1. Bytes as Input.
  2. PTable Input.

  Args:
    examples: A PCollection containing examples. If inference_spec_type is
      None, this is interpreted as a PCollection of queries:
      (InferenceSpecType, Example)
    inference_spec_type: Model inference endpoint. Can be one of:
      - InferenceSpecType: specifies a fixed model to use for inference.
      - PCollection[InferenceSpecType]: specifies a secondary PCollection of
        models. Each example will use the most recent model for inference.
      - None: indicates that the primary PCollection contains
        (InferenceSpecType, Example) tuples.

  Returns:
    A PCollection containing prediction logs.
